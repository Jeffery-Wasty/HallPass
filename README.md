This project was part of the BCIT Co-op Hackathon 2018. The project was completed in the space of 29 hours, from 9AM January 3rd, to 2PM January 4th. Students were assigned in groups of five (5) to solve the problem. The problem students were asked to solve was, 'Solve a common problem BCIT students have'. 

Our group decided that something BCIT students often complain about is finding campus resources, including microwaves, washrooms, and power outlets for charging devices. We decided to make an interactive map of the BCIT Burnaby Campus that would show the amount of each resource in each building, would allow clicking on each building to get a detailed floor-plan, showing the approximate location of each resource, on each floor, and would allow clicking on each resource to gain further information, including a more detailed description, and user rating. For our demonstration we were able to map three (3) resources, to three (3) buildings. The 'more detailed' information was only available to the northmost bathroom of the second floor of SE-05 (clicking on any resource of any type, in any building or floor will give you the exact same 'detailed information' valid only for the bathroom mentioned previously). 

The solution earned us 3rd place in the hackathon. We were quite happy with what we managed to do in the given time, and positive regarding how the program can be expanded, including icons for all buildings, details for all resources, more resources, more campuses, and a mobile app.
